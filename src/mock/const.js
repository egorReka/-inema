  `The film opens following a murder at a cabaret in
  Mexico City in 1936, and then presents the events
  leading up to it in flashback. The Great Flamarion
  (Erich von Stroheim) is an arrogant, friendless,
  and misogynous marksman who displays his trick gunshot
  act in the vaudeville circuit. His show features a
  beautiful assistant, Connie (Mary Beth Hughes) and
  her drunken husband Al (Dan Duryea), Flamarion's other
  assistant. Flamarion falls in love with Connie, the movie's
  femme fatale, and is soon manipulated by her into killing
  her no good husband during one of their acts.`,
